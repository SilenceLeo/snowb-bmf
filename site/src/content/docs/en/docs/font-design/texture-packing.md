Texture packing is a critical step in font asset creation, where glyphs are efficiently arranged into a single image file known as a texture atlas. SnowB BMF leverages advanced bin packing algorithms to automate this process, ensuring your font glyphs are organized compactly to save memory and improve rendering performance.

## Packing Modes: Auto vs. Fixed Size

SnowB BMF offers two primary modes for texture packing, allowing you to prioritize either memory efficiency or specific output dimensions.

### Auto Pack: For Maximum Memory Efficiency

The **Auto Pack** mode intelligently determines the smallest possible texture size for your glyphs. It uses a dynamic sizing algorithm combined with binary search to find the most compact arrangement.

- **Key Benefit:** Minimizes texture memory usage automatically.
- **How it Works:** Calculates the minimum required texture area and disables manual size settings (Width, Height, Fixed Size) to guarantee optimal dimensions.
- **Best For:** General use cases where minimizing memory footprint is the top priority.

### Fixed Size: For Predictable Dimensions

When you need to adhere to specific texture constraints, such as power-of-two dimensions for better GPU performance, use the **Fixed Size** mode. This mode is active only when Auto Pack is disabled.

- **Key Benefit:** Ensures consistent texture sizes, ideal for platforms with specific rendering requirements.
- **Settings:**
    - **Width/Height:** Define the maximum dimensions for the texture atlas.
    - **Fixed Size Checkbox:** Forces the output texture to match these dimensions exactly.
- **Best For:**
    - **GPU Performance:** Use power-of-two dimensions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024) for improved rendering speed and memory handling.
    - **Platform Constraints:** Meet the requirements of game engines or rendering frameworks that expect specific texture sizes.

## Advanced Packing Algorithms

At its core, SnowB BMF uses the **Guillotine Bin Packing** algorithm, a highly efficient method for arranging rectangular glyphs with minimal wasted space. This algorithm is fast enough for real-time previews and supports both dynamic and fixed texture sizing.

When **Auto Pack** is enabled, an additional optimization layer uses binary search to iteratively find the most compact square dimensions before applying the Guillotine algorithm, ensuring the final texture atlas is as small as possible.

## Best Practices for Texture Packing

### General Recommendations
- **Prioritize Auto Pack** for the best memory savings.
- **Use Fixed Size with power-of-two dimensions** (e.g., 512, 1024) for optimal GPU rendering performance.
- **Adjust Spacing:** Find a balance between minimizing spacing and preventing glyphs from bleeding into each other.

### Troubleshooting
- **Glyphs Don't Fit:** If glyphs fail to pack in Fixed Size mode, try increasing the texture dimensions, reducing the number of glyphs, or switching to Auto Pack.
- **High Memory Usage:** Use Auto Pack to ensure the smallest possible texture size.

By understanding and utilizing these texture packing features, you can create highly optimized bitmap fonts that perform well across a wide range of applications.
