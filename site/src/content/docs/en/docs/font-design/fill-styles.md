Fill styles define the inner appearance of your font characters. SnowB BMF offers three powerful options—solid colors, gradients, and image patterns—each providing a distinct visual flair for your bitmap fonts.

You can find all the controls in the "Fill" section of the right sidebar. Every adjustment you make is previewed in real-time, giving you instant visual feedback.

## Solid Colors

The most straightforward fill type, a solid color applies a single, uniform hue across your characters. It's perfect for creating clean, crisp, and highly readable fonts.

**Key Features:**

- **Full-Featured Color Picker**: Choose any color and adjust its transparency (alpha) with ease.
- **Instant Preview**: See your color changes applied to the font immediately.

**Best For:**

- UI elements requiring high contrast and readability.
- Clean, professional typography with a minimalist feel.
- Monochrome or simple color schemes.

## Gradients

Use gradients to create smooth transitions between colors, giving your font a sense of depth, dimension, and vibrancy.

**Gradient Types:**

- **Linear Gradient**: Creates a straight-line color blend. You can control its direction with a 0° to 360° angle, perfect for simulating lighting effects.
- **Radial Gradient**: Creates a circular blend that radiates from a central point, ideal for glows, spotlights, and other highlight effects.

**How to Customize Your Gradient**

Our intuitive gradient editor makes customization easy:

- **Gradient Bar**: This is your main workspace for crafting the gradient.
- **Add Color Stops**: Click anywhere on the gradient bar to add a new color point.
- **Edit Colors**: Click any color stop to open the color picker and change its color.
- **Position Stops**: Drag color stops along the bar to change where the color transition occurs.
- **Remove Stops**: Simply drag a color stop vertically away from the bar to delete it.
- **Adjust Angle (Linear Only)**: Use the visual dial or type in a value to precisely control the gradient's direction.

The default is a simple white-to-black linear gradient, giving you a great starting point.

## Image Patterns

Fill your characters with a custom image or texture to create truly unique and expressive fonts. This feature opens up endless possibilities for creativity.

**Key Features:**

- **Easy Image Upload**: Drag and drop any standard image file to use it as a texture. A thumbnail will show you a preview.
- **Scale Control**: Enlarge or shrink the pattern to get the perfect texture density, with precise adjustments as small as 0.01.
- **Repetition Modes**: Control how the texture tiles within your characters:
  - **`repeat`**: Tiles the pattern seamlessly in all directions.
  - **`repeat-x`**: Repeats the pattern only horizontally.
  - **`repeat-y`**: Repeats the pattern only vertically.
  - **`no-repeat`**: Displays a single instance of the pattern without repeating.

**Best For:**

- **Simulating Materials**: Create fonts that look like wood, metal, fabric, or stone.
- **Branding**: Integrate a logo or brand-specific pattern directly into your font.
- **Artistic Typography**: Design highly decorative and creative fonts.
- **Game Assets**: Make pixel art fonts or text with game-themed textures.
