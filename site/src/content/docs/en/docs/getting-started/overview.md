**SnowB BMF is a free online bitmap font generator** that makes professional font creation accessible to everyone. Whether you're a game developer, pixel artist, or designer, this tool provides a simple **drag and drop interface** for converting TTF, OTF, and WOFF fonts into optimized bitmap fonts—all without writing a single line of code.

SnowB BMF runs entirely in your browser (no download required) while offering professional features like advanced gradients, multi-layer effects, and direct game engine integration. Create production-ready bitmap fonts in minutes with our intuitive web-based tool.

## What is a Bitmap Font?

A bitmap font stores each character (glyph) as a pre-rendered image in a texture atlas. This method ensures pixel-perfect rendering at a fixed size, which is highly efficient for performance-critical applications like games, embedded systems, and UIs where rendering speed and visual consistency are essential.

## How to Create Bitmap Fonts - Step by Step Guide

### 1. TTF to Bitmap Conversion Made Simple
- **Drag and drop** TTF, OTF, or WOFF font files directly into the browser
- **No installation needed** - works instantly as a web-based tool
- Support for **TrueType and WOFF format** conversion
- Define custom character sets including special symbols for games
- **Automatic font size adjustment** for optimal texture usage

### 2. Pixel Font Creation & Customization
- **Pixel font editor** with precise control over each glyph
- Apply **rich visual effects** without coding:
  - Linear and radial gradients
  - Multi-layer shadows with blur
  - Customizable stroke styles
- **Image glyph support** - convert images to font characters
- Adjust metrics and kerning for pixel-perfect alignment
- **Automatic texture size** optimization with whitespace trimming

### 3. Export to AngelCode BMFont Format
- Generate **AngelCode BMFont format** (.fnt/.xml) compatible with all major **game engines**:
  - Unity (TextMesh Pro ready)
  - Godot (BitmapFont resource)
  - Unreal Engine (Slate UI)
  - Cocos2d, Phaser.js, PixiJS
  - Defold, GameMaker Studio
  - DirectX and OpenGL applications
- **Efficient texture atlas** packing reduces memory by 30-50%
- Export optimized PNG atlases with transparency
