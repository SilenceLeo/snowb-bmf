**SnowB BMF** is a practical, web-based tool for creating bitmap fonts. It's designed for game developers, app creators, and designers who need a fast and reliable way to generate font texture atlases.

SnowB BMF is a modern tool that runs entirely in your browser. It requires no installation and respects your privacy by processing all data locally on your machine.

## What is a Bitmap Font?

A bitmap font stores each character (glyph) as a pre-rendered image in a texture atlas. This method ensures pixel-perfect rendering at a fixed size, which is highly efficient for performance-critical applications like games, embedded systems, and UIs where rendering speed and visual consistency are essential.

## What Can You Do with SnowB BMF?

### 1. Generate Your Font
- Import custom `.ttf` and `.otf` font files.
- Define the character set you need, from simple ASCII to extensive international characters.
- Set the font size and basic rendering parameters.

### 2. Customize Appearance and Layout
- **Styling**: Apply visual effects like gradients, strokes, and shadows to match your design.
- **Metrics & Kerning**: Adjust character spacing, offsets, and kerning pairs for optimal readability.
- **Packing**: Configure the texture atlas packer to arrange glyphs efficiently, saving memory.

### 3. Export for Your Project
- **Multiple Formats**: Export font data in standard formats like Text (`.fnt`), XML (`.fnt`), JSON, and binary, ensuring compatibility with most game engines (e.g., Unity, Godot, Unreal) and frameworks.
- **Texture Atlas**: Generate a high-quality PNG image containing all your character glyphs.

## Who is This Tool For?

- **Game Developers**: For creating custom fonts for UI, dialogue, and in-game text.
- **App Developers**: For optimized, consistent font rendering across different platforms.
- **Embedded System Developers**: For creating compact fonts for resource-constrained devices.
- **Web Developers**: For pixel-perfect, retro-style web applications and experiences.

## Key Features at a Glance
